# Brunch + LeafletJS

This is a skeleton for building map applications with LeafletJS and [Brunch](http://brunch.io).

## Installation

Clone this repo manually or use `brunch new dir -s leaflet`

## Getting started

* Install (if you don't have them):
    * [Node.js](http://nodejs.org): `brew install node` on OS X
    * [Brunch](http://brunch.io): `npm install -g brunch`
    * Brunch plugins and app dependencies: `npm install`
* Run:
    * `npm start` — watches the project with continuous rebuild. This will also launch HTTP server with [pushState](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history).
    * `npm run build` — builds minified project for production
* Learn:
    * `public/` dir is fully auto-generated and served by HTTP server.  Write your code in `app/` dir.
    * Place static files you want to be copied from `app/assets/` to `public/`.
    * [Brunch site](http://brunch.io), [Getting started guide](https://github.com/brunch/brunch-guide#readme)

## LeafletJS

The skeleton ships with an example LeafletJS map defined in `app/map.js` and rendered in `index.html`. You can easily
modify or expand upon this map to suit your own purposes.

Leaflet has a [bunch of great tutorials](https://leafletjs.com/examples.html).

## ES-next

To use proposed JS features not included into ES6, do this:

* `npm install --save-dev babel-preset-stage-0`
* in `brunch-config.js`, add the preset: `presets: ['latest', 'stage-0']`
